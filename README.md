## TRRUST  Network

Version: **0.7.0**

Features: Basic Filtering and Visualization

To Do: Possible Improvements to the Weighting algorithm

**New and Updated Graph**:

(Takes a bit of time to load. You can zoom using the scroll wheel on your mouse or a trackpad)

If you go through the **workflow**, you can generate this exact graph yourself.

This graph shows 15 target genes:

```
> genes
 [1] "RELN"     "HLA-DQB1" "FN1"      "MPG"      "BCL2"     "TOP3A"
 [7] "POU5F1"   "MYC"      "LEP"      "MUC5AC"   "TCF4"     "ETS2"
[13] "PHB"      "NFKB1"    "HLA-DPB1"
```

and the transcription factors that **activate** them. If you want you can also filter by other interactions (activation, repression or unknown)
