## TRRUST  Network Workflow

A small tutorial to help you understand how to use the **TRRUST_network.R** module. Download the TRRUST_workflow.R (as well as the main module) and go through it step by step. By the end you will generate the network that is visible on the front page (and then generate other networks you need).
